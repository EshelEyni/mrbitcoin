## Description
Mr. Bitcoin is a crypto wallet. You can sign in and get a balance of 100 fake bitcoins. 
The app header let's you choose a currency and get the bitcoin rate per that currency.
In the contacts page, that supports basic CRUDL, you can choose a contact and transfer them bitcoins from your balance.
In the chart page you can view information about the bitcoin rate the previous year..


A bit about the project - a small App that was built in a few days, which provides the user a list of contacts that they can transfer money to, a basic CRUDL and some information about the value of their fake bank currency in Bitcoin.
